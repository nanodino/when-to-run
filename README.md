# when-to-run

Discord bot that suggests the best time to run in the next 48 hours. There are currently only two commands:

-   `/ping`, which returns `pong`, used to confirm the bot is up and running
-   `/suggest-run-time`, which returns the best time to go for a run in the following 48 hours.

## to do

- allow parameters so it is useful outside of Toronto
- add air quality to things considered by function
